Hobbyist <i>'full-of-nothing-stack'</i>&nbsp; developer involved in many open source activities ðŸ’•<br>
<br>
I'm programming for 5 years - mainly working with JVM based languages and JavaScript <i>(ES6)</i><span class="comma">,</span> occasionally I'm playing with GameDev related stuff.
At this moment I'm studying engineering management at Warsaw University of Technology.<br>
<br>
As I said<span class="comma">,</span> I love to create open source projects<span class="comma">,</span>so check out my <a href="https://github.com/dzikoysk">GitHub profile</a>
