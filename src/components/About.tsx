          I'm programming since 2014 - mainly working with JVM languages <Text as={'span'} fontWeight={'semibold'} fontStyle={'italic'}>(Kotlin, Java, Scala)</Text>,
          but due to product oriented approach I'm also familiar with several frontend technologies.
          Occasionally I'm playing with gamedev related stuff such as OpenGL-based rendering engines, networking & game assets.
